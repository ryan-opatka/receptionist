New Changes Enabling Hosting and Backend Deployment
Backend Deployment to Google Cloud Run:

The Flask backend has been reconfigured to be fully containerized and deployable to Google Cloud Run. This allows the backend to scale dynamically and be accessed publicly without requiring dedicated server management.
A Dockerfile was added to ensure consistent runtime environments across local and production setups. This file defines the backend's dependencies, environment variables, and server configuration:
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8080", "answer:app"]

Environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key, are now securely managed through a .env file. This file is automatically used during both local development and deployment, ensuring sensitive data is not hardcoded or exposed in the codebase.

Instructions were added to guide developers on authenticating with Google Cloud, setting the project, and deploying the backend to Cloud Run. Developers can now easily host the backend with simple commands:

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud run deploy library-api --source . --platform managed --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated

Frontend Integration with Hosted Backend:

The React frontend was updated to dynamically use the hosted backend by setting the API URL in the environment configuration. Developers only need to update the environment variable VITE_API_URL in the .env.production file to point to the deployed Cloud Run URL:

VITE_API_URL=https://library-api-xxxxx.a.run.app

The React app rebuilds this configuration into the production build, ensuring all API requests are directed to the correct hosted backend. This eliminates the need for manual URL changes in the code.

After updating the environment variables, the frontend can be redeployed to Firebase Hosting:

npm run build
firebase deploy

Docker Support for Local Development:

Docker support was introduced to simplify local development and testing of the backend. Developers can now run the backend in a containerized environment, ensuring consistency with the production setup.

The Dockerfile defines the runtime environment and dependencies, allowing developers to build and run the backend as a Docker container:

docker build -t library-api .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env library-api

Developers can then access the backend locally at http://localhost:8080 and test the API:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Where is the library?", "chat_history": []}'

Environment Variable Management:

The introduction of a .env file standardizes how sensitive configuration data, like API keys, is handled. Developers are advised not to commit this file to version control to protect sensitive information.

The .env file format includes:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

This file is automatically used during Docker container runtime and local development, streamlining the process of setting up and running the backend.

Hosting and Deployment Documentation:

Clear documentation was added to explain how to deploy the backend to Google Cloud Run, configure the frontend to connect to the hosted backend, and redeploy the frontend to Firebase Hosting. This ensures other developers can easily host the app or make updates without ambiguity.
Local Testing Instructions:

Developers are now guided on how to run the backend locally using either Flask or Docker. This includes detailed steps for starting the backend, testing the API locally, and ensuring that changes are working correctly before deployment.
python answer.py
npm run dev

These changes enable a streamlined process for hosting and deploying both the backend and frontend, while also simplifying local development and testing for contributors. Let me know if you need further clarification!
