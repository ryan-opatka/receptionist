  "content": "The Libraries will pull available materials for pickup or delivery. Any library user may request that available, circulating items be picked up from the Main Circulation Desk in University (Main) Library. You can also use our Interlibrary Loan to request scans of most articles or book chapters held in print at Evanston campus libraries. Learn about this service. Northwestern Libraries provides faculty, graduate, and distance education students off-campus delivery of Northwestern-owned materials and Interlibrary Loan books. The libraries will ship items out weekly via UPS. Multiple item requests may be packed and shipped separately based on when they are processed. You may return items via mail. See instructions for returning materials.",
