If you are currently using a personal email address with your Zotero account and wish to access unlimited storage, please update your Zotero account with your Northwestern email address. Please note that the storage provided by Zotero is only suitable for public data (such as citations or generally available publications). Please exercise caution when storing files in Zotero that may contain confidential or sensitive information.
