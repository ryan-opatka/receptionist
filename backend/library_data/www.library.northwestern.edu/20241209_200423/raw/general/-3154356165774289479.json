  "content": "The Video Production Studio in Mudd Library is available for individual faculty and student appointments. For instructions on using the equipment, visit the guide for the Video Production Studio. To make an appointment, visit the VPS Calendar. For a consultation request or inquiry regarding the VPS email Ted Quiballo at tquiballo@northwestern.edu. Created by Northwestern Engineering Professor, Michael Peshkin, Lightboard is a glass chalkboard that uses light to allow users to face viewers while writing and recording a lecture. The board is video taped in mirror reflection, giving users a quick and easy way to communicate technical subjects, equations, and sketches, all while engaging with the camera and the viewers. See Lightboard in action. The Self-Service Video Studio in Mudd Library allows faculty, staff, and students to produce and record professional-quality video projects for no cost. Use it to record your presentation or lecture, deliver a research presentation, or to create an instructional demonstration. For more information on Self-service Video technology and equipment, visit the IT Service Catalog. The Libraries offer quarterly workshops on using the Video Production Studio. See the Libraries' events page for upcoming workshops. If you would like to schedule a group workshop or class visit, contact Instructional Technologies Librarian Ted Quiballo at tquiballo@northwestern.edu.",
