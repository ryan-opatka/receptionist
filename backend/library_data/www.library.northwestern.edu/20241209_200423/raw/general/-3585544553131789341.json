  "content": "Assembled over the course of forty years by the late musicologist and avid music collector, Hans Moldenhauer (1906-1987), the Moldenhauer Collection constitutes an unparalleled collection of music manuscripts and other primary sources documenting the history of western music from the Middle Ages through the twentieth century. Today, Moldenhauer's collections are distributed among nine institutions worldwide including Northwestern. Northwestern’s Moldenhauer Collection includes autograph and holograph music manuscripts (both published and unpublished), sketches, quotations, printed scores, transcriptions and arrangements, correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings, programs, engravings, and other materials that document musicians and composers from 1683 to 1973. Additional information about the Moldenhauer Archives, including Northwestern’s collection, may be found in The Rosaleen Moldenhauer Memorial: Music History from Primary Sources: A Guide to the Moldenhauer Archives (Washington: Library of Congress, 2000) and includes a comprehensive inventory for the entire collection across all repositories.
