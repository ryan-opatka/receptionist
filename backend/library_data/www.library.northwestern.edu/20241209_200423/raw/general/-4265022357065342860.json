  "content": "Northwestern Libraries can stream video or audio files, which allows it to be viewed or listened to on a personal computer via an Internet connection. Two services are provided. To find streaming databases available in the Libraries, visit our audio-video database list. Streams for University classes and other programs for faculty, students and staff can be viewed on Canvas course sites. CDs, LPs, audio cassettes, VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray, DV and laserdiscs can be converted. In Canvas, select Course Reserves under Library Resources. Note that a library staff member may need to enroll in your course to provide support; that staffer will appear temporarily as an \"Instructor\" and will un-enroll when they have finished. Submit requests at least one week in advance. If you plan to submit more than 10 titles in a quarter,  give that list to Reserves as soon as possible and before the quarter begins. Contact Reserves at e-reserve@northwestern.edu or by phone at 847-467-1985.",
