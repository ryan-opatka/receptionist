  "content": "Northwestern is welcoming first-year, second-year and transfer students to campus for Winter Quarter. It's been some time since the Libraries have been able to welcome the entire student body— and perhaps it's time to remind everyone how to make use of our services, whether virtually or in person. As always, our virtual resources and consultations are available to all students. This includes 24/7 access to online journals, databases, and ebooks through NUsearch and other collection search tools, and individual research support through chat and research consultations with subject specialists. Computers with specialized software can be accessed remotely, as well. If you are an undergraduate new to campus, the Libraries can offer you in-person services to bolster virtual services beginning today, January 19. Study spaces are reservable in University (Main) Library for individual use. These include spaces for quiet study and for videoconferencing services. The North Study Lounge in Mudd Library is unstaffed but open for individual study. Reserve study space PCs and Macs are available in reservable spaces in the Information Commons. Printing and scanning is also available with an appointment. Microform readers and multimedia carrels are available to view microform, VHS tapes, Blu-Ray, and DVDs, or listen to CDs and LPs.
