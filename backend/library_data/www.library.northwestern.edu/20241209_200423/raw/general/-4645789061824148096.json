  "content": "Library staff offer free workshops on GIS software for beginners and intermediate users. Check the Research and Computing events page for upcoming workshops and to register. The Map and Rare Atlas  Collection is composed of over 200,000 maps, however, only a small portion is searchable via the library catalog, NUsearch. Considering many rare maps are not cataloged, they will require additional time to identify and retrieve for use. Our collection also includes atlases, gazetteers and digital mapping products. The scope of the collection is global with a large portion of U.S. Federal Government holdings. We also collect cartographic publications from state and international governments and commercial publishers. To make an appointment to view the map collection, complete the Map & Rare Atlas Request Form. If you'd like to make a reproduction of a map or rare atlas, complete the Map & Rare Atlas Reproduction Agreement form. Questions? Contact us at govinfo@northwestern.edu. Two GIS professionals are on staff to provide GIS support and instruction to researchers from across academic disciplines. Visit Geospatial and Data Services.",
