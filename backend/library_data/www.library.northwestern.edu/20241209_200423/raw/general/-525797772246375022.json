  "content": "For information on monetary gifts, contact the Director of Development for Libraries, Press and University Archives, Jennifer Mullman, by email or by phone at 847-467-7278. Northwestern University Libraries are deeply grateful to our supporters. With your help, we can continue to provide access of millions of titles to the University community and beyond. The library also welcomes monetary gifts to support its collections, programs and facilities. Learn more about making a financial donation. By endowing an curator role like other important campus roles, Northwestern shows its commitment to high-priority fields of study. An endowed position also ensures that the role attracts and retains the most qualified archivists and curators. Learn more about supporting the Curator for the Black Experience. Northwestern University Libraries no longer accept most donations of books and other materials for the general collections. This change in policy is due to serious space constraints and the high cost of reviewing and processing donated materials. Learn more about donating to our specialty collections. Visit our Donations to Northwestern University Archives page for information about University-related materials.",
