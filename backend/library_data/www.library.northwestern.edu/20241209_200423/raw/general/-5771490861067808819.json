  "title": "Library Account Access Update: Libraries - Northwestern University",
  "content": "As of July 10, there is a new way to log in to your Northwestern Libraries account. If you have a netID and password, your login information will stay the same, but the login page will look different. If you don't have a netID, you will need to take a moment to reset your password using your username or email address. Step-by-step instructions are below. This change came up unexpectedly, and we are sorry we were not able to provide you with more advanced notice. We are dedicated to making sure this change does not affect your library access. As we work through technical issues, the circulation desk is happy to renew or request books for you. Just send us an email at circulation@northwestern.edu or give us a call at 847-491-7633. Sign in to Your Library Account 1) Go to www.library.northwestern.edu and click on “My Account” in the upper right:  2) Select your login option: If you have a netID, select \"Northwestern Users\".  If you don't have a netID, select \"Registered Borrowers\".  3) Enter your username or the email address you use for your library account to receive an email link to reset your password.  4) Check your email. It may take a few minutes for the message containing the reset link to arrive. If you do not receive an email, check your spam or resend the email. If you do not receive an email, give us a call at 847-491-7633",
