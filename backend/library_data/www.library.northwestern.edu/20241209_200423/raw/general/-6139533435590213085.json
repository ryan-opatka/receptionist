  "content": "As we look forward to Winter Recess and then the new year, Northwestern Libraries has updated its available services. The Libraries will be closed for Winter Recess from December 23 at 6pm until January 4 at 8am. Please read below for information on the last day to place requests before this break. The building will be closed December 23 through January 3 for Winter Recess. To ensure the safety of our collections, we will be unable to accept mail-in book returns for the remainder of the month. If you have items to return please mail them after January 3. We will waive any overdue fees that accrue. To see more on returning books and request a pre-paid mailing label, please see Returning Materials. The last day to request reservable study space is December 18. Please visit the page on Study Spaces and Requested Materials to find a link to the calendar and set up your appointments now. The last day to pick up books is December 23. In order to give staff time to pull the book and notify you, please have all requests in by December 18 (this includes books deliveries to home addresses). To see more on how to request a book and the procedures for book pickup in the building, please see Borrowing Materials. Librarians will be available to help you with your research over chat and email through December 23 from 9am to 5pm. From December 24 through January 3, the University is on Winter Recess. Chat will not be monitored during this time, but all digital materials will still be available through NUsearch and any questions can be sent to library@northwestern.edu. A librarian will respond when we return for Winter Quarter.",
