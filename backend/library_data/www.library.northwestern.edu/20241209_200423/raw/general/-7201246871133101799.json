  "content": "Please consider one of these options for passing along your donations: Northwestern University Libraries no longer accept most donations of books and other materials for the general collections. This change in policy is due to serious space constraints and the high cost of reviewing and processing donated materials. Several of the Library's collections handle their gifts directly.  If you have items you would like to donate to a collection listed below, please contact them directly to discuss your donation. Visit our Donations to Northwestern University Archives page for information about University-related materials. Contact Cara List via email or at 847-467-6471. Contact Scott Krafft via email or at 847-491-2895. Contact Esmeralda Kale via email or at 847-491-7684. Contact Greg MacAyeal via email  or at 847-491-4233. Contact Rachel Cole via email or at 847-467-5325. If you feel your potential gift is of critical research interest to the Libraries (rare or unique items), please send your name and contact information along with a description or characterization of the material to gifts@northwestern.edu, or by regular mail to Northwestern University Libraries, Head, Acquisitions, 1970 Campus Drive, Evanston, IL 60208. We will respond as soon as possible. Thank you for your interest in supporting the Northwestern University Libraries.",
