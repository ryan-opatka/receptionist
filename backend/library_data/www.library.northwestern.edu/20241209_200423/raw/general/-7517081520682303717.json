  "content": "Access to and use of electronic resources and online content is restricted to authorized users within the Northwestern University community. The term \"Authorized users\" includes people who are currently associated with Northwestern University, such as faculty, staff and students. Authorized users are responsible for using these electronic resources for individual, noncommercial use only. No one may systematically download, distribute to non-authorized users or retain substantial portions of this licensed information. Some content may be restricted by the publisher to certain Northwestern populations (such as department or school) or campus. Additionally, although we provide access to the general public in some locations, certain resources are not available to the non-Northwestern users due to publisher restriction. Infringement of these basic restrictions may prompt a publisher to deny access to their licensed content to the entire Northwestern University community. Last Review: January 2024",
