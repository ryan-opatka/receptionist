  "content": "Visit the evidence synthesis research guide for step-by-step guidance on conducting a systematized review. If you’d like to meet with a librarian to discuss your project, complete the Evidence Synthesis Consultation Request Form, and someone will be in touch within 48 hours. Whether you’re new to literature searching or an experienced researcher working with a team in a systematic review, we are available to assist with the evidence synthesis process. During a consultation, you will meet with a librarian to discuss your research question(s), go over keyword and database selection, and get an overview of the review process. Consultations are available for students, faculty, and postdocs. They typically take one hour and can be conducted via Zoom or in person. The second tier of support includes more long term and in-depth support from the libraries to researchers who are planning to publish their review. Support includes: Co-authorship is expected when a librarian serves as a collaborator rather than a consultant. To request an initial consultation to discuss the scope of your project, complete the Evidence Synthesis Support Request Form. The Libraries offer regular workshops on conducting literature reviews, systematic reviews, and citation management tools. Visit the Libraries’ event page for a listing of scheduled events. If you’d like us to speak with your group or class on these or related topics, contact us at NUL-EVIDENCESYNTHESIS@LISTSERV.IT.NORTHWESTERN.EDU.",
