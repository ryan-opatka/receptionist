  "content": "Books housed in the University Library and Deering Library are organized first by location, then by call number. Large-sized books (identified by an L or Large) in the same range start at the end of the regular-sized ranges and are immediately to the right when you enter the tower. Use the tables below, along with the building maps, to find books. Wall-mounded stacks guides and maps are posted near the elevators and entrances to the University Library towers. You can also contact the Circulation Department by visiting the Circulation Desk, calling 847-491-7633 or emailing circulation@northwestern.edu. MAIN Large Books are housed in the same rooms as corresponding regular-sized MAIN Library ranges, but shelved separately. Maps of tower rooms and the Lower Level are posted within those areas, with links to online versions included below.",
