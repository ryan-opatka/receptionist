  "content": "To apply for an assigned locker, complete our online locker application. Lockers in University Library and Mudd Library are available for storage of personal items. Numerous assigned lockers are available on levels 3, 4, and 5 of University Library for Northwestern students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars. Locker applications are accepted after September 26, and assignments will be made on a first come, first served basis. If no lockers are available at the time of application, the application will be added to a waiting list. An email will be sent to the email address on the application when a locker becomes available. Keys may be picked up from the Circulation Desk at University Library and will be checked out to a patron account. Both University Library and Mudd Library have day-use lockers that may be used for short-term storage of personal items. The lockers are available in 1S in University Library and near the south entrance of Mudd Library. Day-use lockers are self-service and signage in the space has instructions for setting a 4-digit code. Lockers are cleared out at midnight at the end of each day.",
