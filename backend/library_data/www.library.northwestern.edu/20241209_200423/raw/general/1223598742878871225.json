It links to articles and databases, digital collections of primary resources, reference sources, newspapers, dissertations and theses and more. The Herskovits Library's collection includes photographs, maps, posters, videos, books in African languages, archival materials and manuscripts, as well as art objects, ephemeral materials and other artifacts, many of which are digitally accessible.  The Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies maintains and provides access to unique collections of rare books, archives, manuscripts and photographs. We welcome use of these resources by faculty, students and staff of Northwestern University and by visiting researchers regardless of affiliation. Since the holdings are rare and unique, researchers are expected to be very careful to avoid loss or damage to any materials. Permission to consult materials does not convey the right to reproduce or publish. Researchers are permitted to quote, cite or refer to materials in accordance with the United States copyright law.
