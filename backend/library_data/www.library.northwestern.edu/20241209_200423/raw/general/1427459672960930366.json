This includes establishing a central “Data Library” campus program for the efficient and holistic management of research data across disciplines, and adapting AI models to enable researchers to investigate new types of research questions in our rich collections and datasets. We commit to advancing access to scholarly resources by ensuring that our collections support the current research and academic needs of our community, integrating unique collections with academic programs, and contributing to the Big Ten Academic Alliance BIG Collection.
