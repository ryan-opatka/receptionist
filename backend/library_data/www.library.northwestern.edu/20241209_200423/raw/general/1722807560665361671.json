  "content": "In addition to submitting printing jobs through Northwestern Print, you can also manage your print account: See our full guide on the Northwestern Print system. Whether you are working at a computer at the library or working remotely, you will print through the Northwestern Print.Â A NetID and password are required to log in. You will need to first send a print job, and then release the job from a library printer. Note: Guests who would like to print will need to request a guest netID in the library. Please note: Northwestern Print is only available over the Northwestern network (wired, wireless, and VPN) and is not available over the Guest-Northwestern wireless network. Help connecting to the Northwestern network can be found on the NUIT website or by requesting assistance from the NUIT Support Center. ",
