Reserve items can be physical or electronic. Physical reserve materials are held at and checked out from the University Library Circulation Desk or Mudd Library Circulation Desk. Electronic reserve items are accessed through your course site in Canvas. Books, DVDs and VHS tapes from circulating collections from Northwestern Libraries can be placed on physical Course Reserve.

Book excerpts, newspaper articles, journal articles and database articles can be placed on electronic Reserve. Items in the public domain can be scanned in its entirety for Reserve upon request. See guidelines for providing access to copyright-protected materials.
