  "content": "Applications are open for the Northwestern Libraries Travel Grants to fund research visits scheduled between September 1, 2025 and August 1, 2026. The deadline to apply is April 1, 2025. The Northwestern University Libraries' John Cage Collection is an extensive archive of primary materials documenting the life and work of the 20th centuryâ€™s most revolutionary composer. Established by Cage in the early 1970s, the collection grew considerably over the following decades as Cage placed more and more materials at Northwestern until his death in 1992. Since then, the archive has been expanded further with acquisitions obtained through donation and purchase. As a major repository of original Cage materials, the collection supports the work of scholars worldwide and has been a source for many books, articles and dissertations. Established in 2013 to promote further use of the John Cage Collection, the Northwestern University Libraries John Cage Research Grant is a competitive award for one or more scholars whose research requires substantial on-site use of the Cage Collection. To apply, please submit the following: Applicants should submit the description, curriculum vitae, and budget by e-mail attachment (in PDF format) to librarygrants@northwestern.edu.
