  "content": "The Art Library is located in Deering Library, an architectural landmark built in 1933. It is characterized by its neo-gothic architecture and details such as 68 stained glass window medallions. Deering Library was designed by the renowned architect James Gamble Rogers (1867-1947), who also designed the South Quads, Dyche Stadium, and Scott Hall on Northwestern's Evanston campus and most of the buildings on the University's Chicago campus. Learn more about Rogers and the building's architecture. The Art Library's Martin Reading Room is home to many paintings, including El Bohemio, portrait of composer Erik Satie. Some of Deering Library's window medallions can also be seen here. Read about Library art. Architect Walter Netsch designed the University Library which incorporates elements from his signature architectural aesthetic known as Field Theory, which rotates basic squares into complex geometric shapes. Visit the Walter Netsch website to read an online bibliography, biography, chronology, images and links to more information about Netsch and his work. Copies of the book, Walter A. Netsch, FAIA: A Critical Appreciation and Sourcebook, are held in the Northwestern University Libraries collection and available for purchase through the Northwestern University Press.",
