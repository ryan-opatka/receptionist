  "title": "Understanding Call Numbers: Libraries - Northwestern University",
  "content": "Each book in the library has a unique call number. A call number is like an address: it tells us where the book is located in the library.  Call numbers appear on the spines of books and journals and in the library's catalog.  Note that the same call number can be written from top-to-bottom or left-to-right. Besides the materials in the Government and Geographic Information Collection, the call numbers used by the library are  classified by subject, so you can often find several helpful books on the same shelf, or nearby. The first sections of the call number represent the subject of the book. The letter-and-decimal section of the call number typically represents the author's last name. The last section of a call number is often the date of publication. The library uses three different types of classification schemes to organize various collections and libraries. For more information on understanding call numbers, as well as how to shelve and work with call numbers, visit the Call Numbers Guide.",
