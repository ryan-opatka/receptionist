  "content": "Many items in the Art Library circulate using the Libraries' loan periods and policies. A self-checkout station is located at the Art Library service desk. Materials that do not circulate include: These materials can be viewed on-site or scanned and copied. Additionally, there is a Bookeye scanner in the McCormick Library next door, which can be used for scanning large and fragile books. Exceptions may be made for non-circulating materials. Contact a librarian Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 5 pm for more information. Visitors can make copies using our equipment for scanning, electronic delivery and reproduction: a high resolution color scanner, two flatbed scanners, color and black- and-white printers and color and black-and-white photocopiers, which also allow for scanning and electronic delivery. For help with digital images, please contact the Art Library. We provide opportunities for individual and group research assistance, instruction and consultation. Contact Cara List to schedule a research consultation. Study space in the Art Research Center in Deering Library is available to Art History faculty and graduate students on a first-come, first-served basis.
