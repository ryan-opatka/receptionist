  "content": "Northwestern Libraries is pleased to share the announcement from the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) of the extension of its landmark open publishing agreement with Wiley. The three-year agreement, which will be effective as of January 1, 2023, gives 14 participating universities, including Northwestern, access to publish and read in Wiley’s full journal portfolio, including Hindawi’s gold open access portfolio. With this agreement, corresponding authors from Northwestern and other BTAA campuses will be able to publish their articles as open access in any journal under the Wiley umbrella at no charge, which includes Wiley hybrid and gold journals. Authors will retain their rights to their work under a Creative Commons license and their research will be immediately open and available to the public. The first year of the agreement with the Big Ten saw 2,400 articles published open access. With the extension of this agreement, BTAA is making progress towards its goal for a sustainable open scholarship ecosystem. “We hope that this read and publish agreement with Wiley will make open access publishing more equitable and accessible. The opportunity to publish open access without fees or limits means more opportunities for Northwestern scholars to share their work widely,” says John Blosser, head of Acquisitions at the Northwestern Libraries. For questions about the Wiley agreement, please contact John Blosser, department head for Acquisitions at the Libraries at jblosser@northwestern.edu.",
