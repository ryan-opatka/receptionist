  "content": "Maps and rare atlases from our collection can be viewed in a supervised space in our location. Note that access to physical copies of maps that have been digitized is not allowed unless you can demonstrate the need which would enhance research goals. The majority of maps and rare atlases are not cataloged and require additional time to identify and retrieve for use. To make an appointment, either complete the form or contact us directly at govinfo@northwestern.edu. ",
