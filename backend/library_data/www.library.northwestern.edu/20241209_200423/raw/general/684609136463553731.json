  "title": "File Format Recommendations: Libraries - Northwestern University",
  "content": "The Northwestern University Libraries recommends certain formats be used when planning for long-term preservation of digital content and for possible submission to the digital repository. Generally, the applications used to open files and their specifications become harder to find over time, and some formats will be difficult or impossible to read in the future. The file formats with the best chance of survival have open specifications, are high quality, and are in relatively wide use. Ensuring these formats can be accessed or read in the future is key to their long-term preservation. When considering the long term viability of your digital files, please use the recommended file formats and make sure the format is an uncompressed version, highest quality compressed version, or the final production version. Unfortunately, it's not possible to provide a single list of file formats that are appropriate for all use cases, but this list is a good starting point. Also, please exercise caution when using proprietary formats and digital rights management (DRM) software that may make viewing content difficult or impossible to access in the future. If you have any questions, please contact the Library at library@northwestern.edu. Your question will get routed to the appropriate staff who manage the digital repository.
