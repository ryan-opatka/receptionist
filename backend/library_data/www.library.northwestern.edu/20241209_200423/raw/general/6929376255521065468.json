  "content": "Applications are open for the Northwestern Libraries Travel Grants to fund research visits scheduled between September 1, 2025 and August 1, 2026. The deadline to apply is April 1, 2025. Applications are currently closed for the OER Faculty Grant and the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant. Applications for Summer 2025 Undergraduate Research grants will open in Spring 2025 and applications for the 2026 OER grant will open in fall 2025. We offer several grant opportunities to support the work of Northwestern faculty and students as well as researchers across the globe. Each year, we will award a Summer Undergraduate Research Grant (URG) to one Northwestern undergraduate student. The grant will support an independent academic or creative project that utilizes library collections and expertise in the field of study of Native American and Indigenous research. The grant provides $4,000 to cover living expenses for eight weeks of full-time independent research under the supervision of a faculty advisor and the guidance of a librarian mentor. Apply via the Office of Undergraduate Research. The Affordable Instructional Resources (AIR) initiative invites faculty to apply for grant funding to develop open educational resources (OER) for undergraduate courses. To see previously awarded projects, visit the OER Grant Recipients page. We invite applications from researchers unaffiliated with Northwestern to pursue projects that require substantial onsite use of our collections and draw upon the expertise of our curators, librarians and staff.",
