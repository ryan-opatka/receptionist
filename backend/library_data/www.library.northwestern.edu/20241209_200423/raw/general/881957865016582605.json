  "content": "All retirees with an active Wildcard may access library facilities and may borrow materials from Northwestern Libraries’ collections. Retirees with an active NetID may access databases, electronic journals, and other online resources from off campus. Those without a current NetID may obtain a guest NetID for temporary in-library access to most online resources. Retirees with an active Wildcard may use non-circulating research materials, including rare books, manuscripts, and archives. To schedule use of non-circulating materials, contact the McCormick Library of Special Collections & University Archives, the Herskovits Library of African Studies, or the Transportation Library. All retirees are welcome to attend symposia, workshops, exhibits, and other pubic programs presented by Northwestern Libraries. See the Libraries’ website for information on current and upcoming Events and Exhibits. Faculty who have a closed study carrel at the time of their retirement and are granted emeritus status may renew that carrel annually for up to five years following retirement. Extensions beyond five years may be granted in special circumstances, with approval of the Dean of Libraries. Northwestern Libraries are especially interested in learning of rare materials or highly specialized collections offered for donation. Standard academic books and other general materials are usually not accepted. See Donating Books and Printed Materials for more information. Northwestern University Archives welcomes donations of original materials that document faculty careers.",
