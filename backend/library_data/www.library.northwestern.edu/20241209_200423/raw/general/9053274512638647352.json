  "title": "Multi-factor authentication required for electronic resources: Libraries - Northwestern University",
  "content": "Northwestern University Libraries, Pritzker Legal Research Center, Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center, Qatar Library, and the Styberg Library are adding an extra layer of security for all electronic resources, including journals and databases. Beginning July 1, users accessing electronic resources will sign-on as usual using Online Passport and then be prompted to use Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). This means journals, databases and e-books will live behind this extra security step before being accessible to our community. The Northwestern community is already familiar with this technology, which is now required to access many self-service University-wide systems, including myHR, NUFinancials, CAESAR, and GlobalProtect VPN. Why are we making this change — especially now, amid the many other changes we’ve all undergone in our current work environment? This security upgrade has been in the works for some time, because passwords alone are no longer adequate to protect us from theft of our academic intellectual property. When even a single password is compromised, it can (and has, on several occasions) led to the campus-wide deactivation of our access to valuable resources. If you have not already done so, please set up your Duo Mobile MFA account before July 1 with these straightforward steps: See here for more information about Multi-factor Authentication at Northwestern University. If you have further concerns regarding how this will affect your interaction with library materials, please contact library@northwestern.edu.",
